## Overall introduction

---
This course aims to provide students with a fundamental understanding of the principles and applications of robot path planning and control through simulations and physical experiments. Throughout the course, we utilize a laboratory-developed simulation platform for control and planning simulations. Subsequently, we conduct control and planning experiments using DJI's RoboMaster EP series small vehicles and TT unmanned aerial vehicles, along with indoor positioning using UWB devices from nooploop company. After students have learned the control and planning theories, they deepen their understanding through simulation and physical experiments. The course consists of eight sessions in total: the first three sessions cover relevant theory presented by Professor HAN Liang, the following three sessions involve my instruction on simulation and physical experiments, and the final two sessions include the evaluation of simulation and experimental results.

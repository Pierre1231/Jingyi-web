Badminton has been a longstanding interest of mine. I am also an avid reader of economics and social sciences literature, and I am proficient in [English](/misc/ielts_JingyiHUANG.pdf) and [French](/misc/tcf.pdf). I have had the opportunity to travel extensively across Europe, visiting France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, and Malta.

My travels have inspired my passion for photography. I am drawn to capturing the essence of diverse places, people, and moments through my lens. For additional works, please visit my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/jingyi.huang_98/).

Badminton has been my passion for years. I also enjoy reading books on economics and social sciences, and learning languages like English and French. I've traveled to several European countries including France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, and Malta.

Traveling inspired me to become a photographer. I enjoy capturing the essence of different places, people, and moments through my camera. Below are some of my works. For more, follow my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/jingyi.huang_98/).

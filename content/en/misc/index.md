    Badminton🏸 has been a passion of mine for years, and I've practiced it for three years. Even now, it remains my favorite sport. Alongside badminton, I enjoy reading books:book: on economics and social sciences to gain a better understanding of the world around me. Learning about different cultures is also a passion of mine, thus I learn different languages such as English and French. And I have been fortunate enough to travel to several European countries including France:fr:, Germany:de:, Spain:es:, Belgium🇧🇪, Italy🇮🇹, Switzerland🇨🇭, and Malta🇲🇹.

    Traveling has inspired me to become a photographer. I enjoy capturing the essence of different places, people, and things through the lens of my camera. I have attached some of my work below, but if you want to see more, feel free to follow my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/jingyi.huang_98/) where I post my latest creations.
